    <h3> Medical Imaging </h3>

    <p>
        Machine learning is gradually becoming more prominent in medical imaging. Machine learning algorithms have been designed that can analyze various X-rays and other medical images. Most of the time, these algorithms are rooted in the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs analyze individual pixels to detect certain features in an image. The CNNs are then trained, using large amounts of data, to “learn” what an instance of an item looks like. This is immensely useful in medical imaging. There is always the off chance that a radiologist will miss an abnormality when reviewing images - using machine learning algorithms can lessen this risk.

    <h3> Diagnosis & Prognosis </h3>

        Machine learning is also incredibly useful for diagnosing various conditions. By analyzing large sets of data, the algorithms can pick up on subtle predictors and risk factors. These components may go unnoticed by a physician due to their sometimes negligible nature. When paired with the advancements that machine learning has had in medical imaging, these technologies have the potential to detect issues much sooner. This in turn leads to quicker prognoses and an increased chance of a patient having an improved outcome.

        Finally, machine learning is being used in the pharmaceutical field to develop a variety of drugs, equipment, and processes. Machine learning algorithms can work with target validation, prognostic biomarkers, and other components of a study to make accurate predictions and recommendations.
