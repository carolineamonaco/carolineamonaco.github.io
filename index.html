    My name is Caroline Monaco. I am a second year Data Science and Business Administration major with a concentration in Healthcare Management and Consulting. I began working in the healthcare industry in 2020. At the time, I had been looking for an internship in some area of government, as I wanted to pursue political science. Most local government opportunities were suspended due to COVID-19, but my state’s Department of Health was hiring an intern. I figured this was “close enough” to a role in government, and applied for the role. I was accepted and immediately fell in love with the healthcare industry. I found that healthcare encapsulated all of my academic interests - science, history, government, and economics. From that point on, I knew that I wanted to work in healthcare.

    My interest in data science came later, shortly after I had arrived at Northeastern. I was looking for another major to add to my Business: Healthcare Management and Consulting major. I had prior coding experience in high school, but had not legitimately considered it as an option. Frankly, it was my many friends in Khoury that convinced me of the rapidly developing prominence of technology in healthcare. I decided to add a Data Science major and, similarly to healthcare, quickly found myself immensely passionate about coding.

    I am deeply interested in machine learning and its applications in the healthcare industry. Eventually, I want to work to develop machine learning algorithms that combat pressing medical challenges. On this website, I explore the various ways that machine learning is poised to be widely used in healthcare.
